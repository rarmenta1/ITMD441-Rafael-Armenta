          I have taken both ITMD-361 and ITMD-362 so I am already a bit familiar with html, css, and javascript. I just have to try to remember 
          more about as it feels kind of a long time ago and I probably forgot somethings. So far I am really enjoying writing html, css, and javascript. So
          I am pretty excited to be taking another course that deals with html, css, and javascript. Every now and then I like to build websites for fun just so I 
          can try out new things with html, css, and javascript, and even learn new things while I am at it. I am really looking forward to learn how I can not only
          improve my code but also learn more about it as it is my favorite thing to learn about in school.

          Hello! My name is Rafael Armenta. I am a third year ITM student and I am really looking forward to learning more about web development. From all the courses
          I have taken at IIT, I have got to say that web development has been the most enjoyable one so far. Besides learning more about web development I like to play video games,
          watch anime, and hanging out with friends.
