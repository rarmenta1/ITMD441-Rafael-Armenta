          I have taken both ITMD-361 and ITMD-362 so I am already a bit familiar with html, css, and javascript. I just have to try to remember 
          more about as it feels kind of a long time ago and I probably forgot somethings. So far I am really enjoying writing html, css, and javascript. So
          I am pretty excited to be taking another course that deals with html, css, and javascript. Every now and then I like to build websites for fun just so I 
          can try out new things with html, css, and javascript, and even learn new things while I am at it. I am really looking forward to learn how I can not only
          improve my code but also learn more about it as it is my favorite thing to learn about in school. Anyways, here is the intro to the class and me. I am assuming
          we will be updating our pages as time goes on so here is some placeholder text I guess. I wanted to add a navigation bar on top of the page but I do not have 
          any other html files to point to so hopefully we can add some in the future because right now this page feels kind of empty.

          Hello! My name is Rafael Armenta. I am a third year ITM student and work part time at an Amazon Fulfillment Center. I am really looking forward to learning more about 
          web development. From all the courses I have taken at IIT, I have got to say that web development has been the most enjoyable one so far. Besides learning more about 
          web development I like to play video games, watch anime, and hanging out with friends. I have a pretty good feeling about the rest of the year as this year has been 
          pretty eventful. I tried many new things, met some great people, went through some stuff both good and bad, but overall it feels like it has been one of my greatest 
          years of all time. Anyways, here is some more placeholder text just so I can fill this page up with more text.
